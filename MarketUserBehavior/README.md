## (400, 5):
- This indicates that the dataset has 400 rows and 5 columns.

- User ID Gender Age EstimatedSalary Purchased:

- There are no missing values (0) in any of the columns.
- The columns are: 'User ID', 'Gender', 'Age', 'EstimatedSalary', and 'Purchased'.

## Gender:

- Gender distribution: Female - 204, Male - 196.
- This suggests a relatively balanced distribution of gender in the dataset.

## Age Distribution:

 - The output seems to be a histogram (AxesSubplot) of the 'Age' column, showing the distribution of ages in the dataset.

## EstimatedSalary Distribution:

- Similarly, the output appears to be a histogram (AxesSubplot) of the 'EstimatedSalary' column, indicating the distribution of estimated salaries.

## Purchased by Age and EstimatedSalary:

- A multi-level index DataFrame showing the 'Purchased' column values for different combinations of 'Age' and 'EstimatedSalary'.
- For example, for users aged 18 with an estimated salary of 44000, the 'Purchased' value is 0.0.

## Purchased by Gender and Age:

- Similar to the previous output, this shows the 'Purchased' column values for different combinations of 'Gender' and 'Age'.
- It indicates the likelihood of purchase for users based on their gender and age.

## Average EstimatedSalary by Purchase Status:

- The average estimated salary for users who did not make a purchase (Purchased = 0) is approximately 60544.75, and for those who made a purchase (Purchased = 1) is approximately 86272.73.

## Correlation Coefficient:

- The correlation coefficient between the 'Age' and 'Purchased' columns is 0.775.
- This suggests a relatively strong positive correlation between age and the likelihood of making a purchase.

Overall, the analysis provides insights into the demographic distribution, purchase behavior based on age and gender, and the relationship between estimated salary, age, and purchase status. The correlation coefficient suggests a significant positive correlation between age and the likelihood of making a purchase.
